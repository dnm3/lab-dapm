 # Lab 6

 * In the first exercise we added 2 buttons and a textView
 * then in the 2nd exercise we added the missing code as explained in the lab above the Exercises
 * we proceded to the ex 3 and created another activity 
 * then in ex4 we added the button that saves text in  SharedPreference.
 * To make an intent we had to look in previews labs, same goes for the ex7.
 * For the exericise 6 we just changed colours and background from the xml using the design view.
